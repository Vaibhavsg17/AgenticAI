# Multi-Agent System with Phi

This project demonstrates a **multi-agent** system using the `phi` framework. It consists of two specialized agents:

- **Web Agent**: Searches the web for information.
- **Finance Agent**: Retrieves financial data such as stock prices, analyst recommendations, and fundamentals.
- **Agent Team**: A combination of the above agents to collaboratively process queries.

## Features

- **Web Search**: Uses DuckDuckGo to fetch online information.
- **Financial Data Retrieval**: Uses Yahoo Finance tools for stock-related data.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Agents work together to generate comprehensive responses.

## Expected Output

The multi-agent system will:

- Fetch stock fundamentals and analyst recommendations for TSLA and NVD.
- Search the web for additional relevant information.
- Combine and display the results in a structured format (with sources and tables).
